# Temporal Databases: Theory and Postgres

These are the slides and my notes for a talk about temporal databases given at pdxpug 21 February 2019 then again at PGCon 2019 in Ottawa on 31 May 2019. It is built on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

You also can get [all the slides as a PDF](slides.pdf),
or [read the slides' Markdown with speaker notes](slides.md).

## Development

You can run the slides locally by saying:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can get a slideshow-able PDF by going to http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf *in Chrome* and printing to a PDF. This is what you want to save as `slides.pdf`.

You can include speaker notes by going to http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf&showNotes=separate-page *in Chrome*, printing to a PDF, then printing the PDF. It uses a custom hack to get separate-page speaker notes with a white background. This is what you want to print before you give the talk.
