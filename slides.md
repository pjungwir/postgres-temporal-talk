# Temporal Databases:
## Theory and Postgres

PGCon 2019

Note:

- Thanks for coming!
- I'm Paul Jungwirth....
- independent consultant/programmer from Portland, OR

- used Postgres since ~2010.
- I've done substantial professional work in Oracle, MySQL, and MS SQL Server, but Postgres is by far the best.

- Not a contributor but I've written a bunch of extensions.
- Since I'm from Portland: they're pretty obscure, you probably haven't heard of them.

- Actually I did dip my toe in the contributor waters a few years ago:
- I wrote a patch adding UUID support to `btree_gist`, which we'll see is actually relevant to temporal databases.
- Also I have a few patches waiting for review now for more temporal db support.
- (We'll get to those.)

- I've been interested in temporal databases for several years,
- I've read 3/4ths of the books in English and a lot of the papers.
- Almost every project I work on I wish I had easy temporal database support.
- Now that SQL:2011 has standardized some of the functionality,
  more and more vendors are supporting it,
  and I hope Postgres will too!
- I want to give an overview of temporal concepts and features,
  and then talk about SQL:2011 and Postgres.
- Finally I'll give a quick survey of SQL:2011 in the other RDBMSes out there.



# Temporal<br/>`IS DISTINCT FROM`<br/>Time-Series
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 70%" -->

time-series | temporal
----------- | --------
single timestamp | two timestamps
records events       | records things
IoT sensors, finance | auditing, history
challenge is scale   | challenge is complexity
Partitioning         | ranges, exclusion constraints
Citus, TimescaleDB   | `temporal_tables`, Tardis

Note:

- So first of all, a temporal database is not the same as a time-series database.
- Nowadays time-series is all the rage, with web analytics, advertising, IoT sensor data.
- Temporal is something else.
- In time-series every record has a single time stamp; in temporal every record has two: start & end.
- In time-series you record events; in temporal, things (different versions throughout the thing's lifetime)
- Purposes: temporal has two: the history of changes to the database, the history of the thing "out there".
- Challenges:
  - timeseries: scale (but the structure is simpler)
  - temporal: moderate scale, but lots of complexity. Correctness is a challenge.
- Tools in Postgres:
  - timeseries: partitioning
  - temporal: ranges, exclusion constraints: very solid foundation, but no higher-level concepts yet
- Products in Postgres:
  - timeseries: Citus, TimescaleDB
  - temporal:
    - Teradata has had support for a long time
    - `temporal_tables` extension gives you one dimension (db history) but not the other (thing history).



# Temporal = Historical

<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 80%" -->
- e-commerce: product price
- real estate: house renovations <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- employees: position, salary, employment period <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- questionnaires: changing questions, options <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

- Instead of "temporal databases" maybe we should say "historical databases", because it's about tracking history.
- (We could store future things too, but that's less common.)

- Accidentally changing history is especially acute in OLTP databases where everything is normalized.
- Almost every project I see the need.
  - show slides
    - product price:
      - stored on your `products` table
      - when you change it, your orders don't add up any more.
      - Of course everyone knows this, so they copy the price over to the `line_items` table.
      - But this is an ad hoc solution.
      - They aren't copying:
        - the product tags,
        - which countries the product was available in,
        - the product's vendor's commission
        - cost of inventory is really hard too
      - In practice very few companies can re-generate their 2016 sales report and get the same answers as before.
    - real estate:
      - when did the property change?
    - employees
      - You can't give a database talk without an employees table.
      - You might want to know their salary history, their former positions, former projects, etc.
    - questionnaires:
      - For 20 years I've been building the same app over and over:
        - I call it "some users design forms, some users fill out forms."
        - I bet a lot of you have been building this thing too.
      - So what happens when you revise a question?
      - What if you're asking for Ethnicity and you change the possible answers?
      - In a normalized database you lose history, and sense can turn into nonsense.
- Today people just tolerate the errors.
- Retaining correct history requires foresight:
  - Copying product price to the line item.
  - Someone told me about a major fast food restaurant that wanted to brag about how much healthier their mayonnaise had become over time, but when they went to look up the details they found they no longer had the data.
- Even when they solve it, they aren't aware of the 30 years of research, so they apply an ad hoc solution.



# OLAP Problems Too

![star schema](img/star_schema.png)

Note:

- Reporting databases (OLAP, data warehouses) are denormalized, so duplication helps retain historical information.
- Quintessential structure is a star schema:
  - like a spreadsheet with just one level of normalization
  - facts surrounded by dimensions
- Facts capture history because they are almost always dated.
- The dimensions don't necessarily have history.
  - product changes
  - stores come and ago and change
  - Kimball calls these "slowly-changing dimensions" (SCDs).



# "Slowly-Changing Dimensions"

- Type I: Overwrite it
- Type II: Add a Row
- Type III: Add a Column

Note:

- Slowly-changing dimensions are proof that even OLAP databases need temporal features.
- I have to credit Tom Johnston (author of two books on temporal databases) for connecting SCDs to temporal features.
  - He also brings some reality to Slowly-Changing Dimensions when he asks, "What do you mean slow?"

- Basically none of Kimball's suggestions are very good:
  - Enough to say that nowadays there are also Types 0, 1.5, 4, 5, 6, and 7!
- SKIP IT!:
  - Kimball's work is amazing: my point is just that temporal data is not just a problem for normalized schemas.

- Type I: overwrite it: ignore the problem: accept bad history.
- Type II: add a row:
  - might lose entity continuity:
    - Hopefully you have a durable key between rows, like a SKU, but then you might not.
    - Even if you do, following that link isn't likely to be supported by standard query-building GUIs that fit on top of star schemas.
- Type III: add a column:
  - one column to hold the old value, one to hold the new value.
  - dimension tables might have 20 columns, so you are going to have 40 columns now?
    - So for products you have an extra column for "prior department", "prior name", etc.
  - This only lets you remember a single change.
- Actually nowadays there are also Type 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7 SCDs!
  - Type 4: break some `products` attributes out into a separate mini-dimension.
  - Type 5: add a mini-dimension, and also a Type I outrigger to the major dimension table.
  - Type 6: add Type I attributes to a Type II dimension: in other words "current" vs "original".
    - This is a lot like Type 3, only we keep "original" instead of "prior"?
  - Type 7: Have both a Type I dimension and a Type II dimension!
  - This is getting complicated!

- The point isn't to criticize SCD,
  - but to use them as evidence that we need temporal databases, even in denormalized structures.
  - And if Facts are events, Dimensions are things, so they are a good fit for a temporal structure.
- And actually to give credit to Kimball:
  - He discusses adding start/end times to dimension rows,
    - and has some caveats about what an effective time might mean,
      - e.g. for a product whose v1 is sold after v2 is released.
    - But I feel like these are not the norm,
      - and if you're selling two versions of something at the same time it is really two separate products.



# Research

![Time-Oriented Database Applications in SQL](img/snodgrass4.png)

Note:

- If you want the start reading about temporal databases, this is the book.
- It even comes as a free PDF.
- From the late 90s
- Lots of SQL, including many different dialects.
- Tough to get through because of the combinatorial explosion:
  - valid-time vs system-time vs bitemporal
  - snapshot query vs sequenced vs non-sequenced
  - inner join vs outer join
  - Oracle vs DB2 vs Access vs Informix vs MS SQL Server vs UniSQL
  - SELECT vs INSERT vs UPDATE vs DELETE
- Compehensive: covers tons of ground and pulls it all together.
- Snodgrass tried to get temporal features standardized back in the 90s.
  - I was pretty annoyed to discover we could have had this stuff 20 years ago.
  - But the criticisms had some good points, and maybe the wait was worth it.

# Temporal example

![temporal products rows](img/products_rows.png)

![temporal products timeline](img/products_timeline.png)

Note:

- So what does a temporal table even look like?
- It gets two extra columns for start & end time.
- Here I'm using months but it could be days, seconds, nanoseconds, or whatever.
- A blank value means unbounded or infinite.
  - You could also use sentinels like Jan 3000.
- It's nice to plot this on a timeline.

- Can't we make do with just one timestamp?
	- Just store the start date, and assume it ends when the next record starts?
	- Not really: one statement's end date is not the same as another statement's start date.
		- You could have gaps.
	- Plus a single timestamp makes it really hard to query: each row needs info from outside itself.

- Shocking that the primary key is not unique. (We'll talk more about that later.)

# Temporal example

![temporal products rows with ranges](img/products_rows_ranges.png)

![temporal products timeline](img/products_timeline.png)

Note:

- We can make a nice refinement here.
- Postgres has built-in range types: combine two columns into one.
- They are automatically closed/open, which is the convention.
- Notation of [x,y), notation of `*---o` (algebra class).
- Closed/open makes it easy for them to "snap together", used in most of the literature.
- One disadvantage is you can't have a zero-width range: it's just a self-contradiction.
  - But why would you want that?
  - If you have duration-less time periods then really you have events: get a time-series database.
- Range types vs two columns:
  - Lots of built-in operators
  - You can have a range on any type you want.
    - Builtin date/timestamp/int, but you can define a floatrange, or even e.g. my inetrange extension.
  - Exclusion constraints: easy to index
  - Advantages indexing ranges vs a two-column btree index
    - I *think* indexing an int+range gives you faster queries than indexing an int+timestamp+timestamp,
      but I'm not sure.
    - Maybe someone here could say for sure.
    - Btw here's something I've often searched for and never found:
      - I would love to hear a talk going into the data structure differences between B-Tree, GIN, and GiST, and *why* that makes them more or less suitable to different tasks.
      - I'm especially confused because we have a built-in btree type that is different from GIN & GiST,
        but then we have extensions called `btree_gin` and `btree_gist`.



# Range Operators
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 60%" -->

Operator | Description | Example | Result
-|-|-|-
= | equal | int4range(1,5) = '[1,4]'::int4range | t
<> | not equal | numrange(1.1,2.2) <> numrange(1.1,2.3) | t
< | less than | int4range(1,10) < int4range(2,3) | t
> | greater than | int4range(1,10) > int4range(1,5) | t
<= | less than or equal | numrange(1.1,2.2) <= numrange(1.1,2.2) | t
>= | greater than or equal | numrange(1.1,2.2) >= numrange(1.1,2.0) | t

Note:

- Ranges come with a bunch of nice operators.
- less than and greater than are not what I'd expect: they are more like alphabetical: compare the first letter, if it's tied compare the second letter.



# More Operators
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 60%" -->

 | | |&nbsp;
-|-|-|-
@> | contains range | int4range(2,4) @> int4range(2,3) | t
@> | contains element | '[2011-01-01,2011-03-01)'::tsrange @> '2011-01-10'::timestamp | t
<@ | range is contained by | int4range(2,4) <@ int4range(1,7) | t
<@ | element is contained by | 42 <@ int4range(1,7) | f
&& | overlap (have points in common) | int8range(3,7) && int8range(4,12) | t
<< | strictly left of | int8range(1,10) << int8range(100,110) | t
>> | strictly right of | int8range(50,60) >> int8range(20,30) | t

Note:

- The `@>` and `<@` operators are some of my favorites, e.g. "was Fred employed at time t?"
- Overlap is really useful too:
  - include all the employees who were employed during 2018.



# And More
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 60%" -->

 | | |&nbsp;
-|-|-|-
&< | does not extend to the right of | int8range(1,20) &< int8range(18,20) | t
&> | does not extend to the left of | int8range(7,20) &> int8range(5,10) | t
-&#124;- | is adjacent to | numrange(1.1,2.2) -&#124;- numrange(2.2,3.3) | t
+ | union | numrange(5,15) + numrange(10,20) | [5,20)
* | intersection | int8range(5,15) * int8range(10,20) | [10,15)
- | difference | int8range(5,15) - int8range(10,20) | [5,10)

Note:

- The "does not extend to the left/right of" operators are useful for building a temporal UPDATE trigger, although I don't know why they are negated. I've only ever used them with double negatives.

- These operators bear some resemblance to the "Allen Relationships".
- There are 13 ways that two ranges could be related to each other:
  - A before B
  - A touches B
  - A overlaps some of B
  - A overlaps all of B
  - A subsumes B
  - ...
- Everyone who talks about temporal tables brings up the Allen Relationships.
- You can read the Wikipedia page yourself.
- It's not that complicated.
- To be honest it doesn't seem worthy of getting your own Wikipedia page.
- *But* if you don't have range types and you're implementing these comparisons yourself,
  it is surprisingly hard to get them right. There are a lot of cases to cover.



# Lots easier

```
WHERE employed_during @@ [2018-01-01,2019-01-01)
```

vs

```
WHERE employed_from < '2019-01-01'
AND   '2018-01-01'  < employed_til
```

Note:

- Only two lines to do it yourself?
- But two lines are very subtle.
- To me anyway it's not obvious that that means "overlaps" and that it's correct.



# Two Dimensions
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 60%" -->

Valid Time | Transaction Time
-----------|-----------------
history of the thing | history of the database
application features | auditing, compliance
user can edit        | immutable
maintained by your app | maintained by triggers
constraints matter | look Ma, no hands!
nothing | pg: `temporal_tables`, "A Tardis for Your ORM", `pg_audit_log`
nothing | Rails: `papertrail`, `audited`, `chronomodel`

Note:

- So far I've only talked about valid-time.
- But I mentioned there are at least two dimensions of meaningful history:
  - the thing "out there"
  - the history of changes to your database
  - Some authors propose even more dimensions.
- You could even have both dimensions for the same table!
- Then you have two start/end pairs, i.e. two ranges.
- Now it's really getting hard to understand.
- The two dimensions don't necessary have the same "physical" representation:
  - maybe the audit history is stored in a separate view.
  - Snodgrass gives several implementation choices for bitemporal tables.

- I'm going to talk almost exclusively about valid-time.
  - This is the more interesting: the history of the thing.
  - But it's harder.
  - There are lots of solutions for system-time already.
    - This is maintained automatically, e.g. by triggers.
  - Valid-time is in the hands of your users: it's application-level functionality.
    - Therefore constraints are more important.



# Terminology
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 80%" -->

|||&nbsp;
-|-|-
Snodgrass | valid time | transaction time
Fowler    | actual time | record time
Date/Darwen/Lorentzos | stated time | logged time
Johnston | effective time/<br/>state time | assertion time
SQL:2011 | application time | system time

Note:

- Btw, no one agrees on terminology.
- There is actually a document called "The Consensus Glossary of Temporal Database Concepts" . . .from 1998.



# Non-Unique PKs

![temporal products rows with ranges](img/products_rows_ranges_invalid.png)

Note:

- Let's start with the simplest possible thing: primary keys!
- PKs can be non-unique, as long as their valid time doesn't overlap.
  - So product 3 in red is invalid: the two versions overlap.
  - If each row is supposed to be a true proposition,
    this is like stating a contradiction.

- But as long as the ranges don't overlap, the PK isn't unique.
- Uniqueness is a pretty foundational idea; non-unique PKs is crazy!
- No unique index will give us what we want.
  - I won't work that out, but you can try later if you want.
- A great way of thinking about this comes from....



# Another Book

![Time and Relational Theory](img/date_darwen_lorentzos.jpg)

Note:

- Date/Darwen/Lorentzos: really you have one row per second, but we abbreviate it for performance and ease-of-use.
  - Then you have real unique PKs: just include the time in the PK.
  - But in the abbreviated form, we have this weird situation where there is no way to define a correct unique constraint.
- If you've ready their other books you know they are very mathematical;
 - strict purists:
 - no nulls,
 - no duplicate rows.
 - I hope you weren't expecting to see any S-Q-L!
 - This book has a similar rigor but is still very practical.
- If you read one book about temporal databases, I'd read this one.
- Also very influential on Postgres range types.
- Anyway we have this problem of non-unique primary keys, but we still want some kind of constraint....



# Exclusion constraints
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide none" -->

```
ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_products
EXCLUDE USING gist
(id WITH =, valid_at WITH &&);
```

Note:

- Enter Exclusion Constraints!
- Exclusion constraints are "generalized uniqueness constraints".
- There must be no other rows where all the operators evaluate to true when compared to this row.
  - If it has the same id *and* an overlapping valid time, then it's forbidden.
- (show the next slide)



# Exclusion constraints
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none none" -->

```
ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_products
EXCLUDE
(id WITH =);
```

Note:

- Here is an exclusion constraint that enforces ordinary uniqueness.
- But exclusion constraints can do *more* than uniqueness constraints.
- (next slide)



# Exclusion constraints
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none slide" -->

```
ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_products
EXCLUDE USING gist
(id WITH =, valid_at WITH &&);
```

Note:

- It's okay if another row has the same id, as long as it's for a different time.
- It's okay if two records has overlapping time, as long as they have different ids.
- Like a uniqueness constraint, an exclusion constraint is always backed by an index to enforce it efficiently. Sometimes it can be a regular b-tree index, but when combining a scalar and a range it needs to be a GiST index like here.
- As far as I know exclusion constraints are a Postgres-only innovation.

- We could call this a "temporal primary key".
- You can do this today, but Postgres doesn't *know* that it's a so-called primay key.



# Exclusion constraints

```
CHECK (
  NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM   products t1
    WHERE  1 < (
      SELECT COUNT(id)
      FROM   products t2
      WHERE  t1.id = t2.id
      AND    t1.valid_at && t2.valid_at))
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM   products t3
    WHERE  p3.id IS NULL)
)
```

Note:

- Here is how Snodgrass says to do it, from the 90s before exclusion constraints.
- Actually he didn't have an overlaps operator either.
- Besides being hard to grasp and error-prone, it may not be very fast.
- Also Postgres won't let you write a `CHECK` constraint that sees more than the current row, so you need to use a trigger instead.



# Foreign Keys
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide none" -->

![traditional foreign keys](img/variants_rows.png)

Note:

- Now that we have primary keys, let's add foreign keys.
- First let's look at *traditional* referential integrity:
- Here is a "variants" table, common in e-commerce applications.
- A product has one or more variants; every variant has a product.
- It's a basic parent-child relationship.
- Variant 4 in red is forbidden; we don't even know what kind of product it is.



# Temporal Foreign Keys
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none slide" -->

![traditional foreign keys](img/variants_rows_ranges.png)

Note:

- A temporal foreign key gets a little weird, because ids are no longer unique.
- It helps to remember the Date/Darwen/Lorentzos idea of "one row per second".
  - In that case temporal foreign keys are just like regular foreign keys:
  - every instant of the child record needs a corresponding instant of the parent record.
- Variant 1 is simple: its whole lifespan is fulfilled by the product 1.
- Variant 2 is tricky: it didn't change when the product did, so its lifespan requires the *sum* of the records for product 1.
- Variant 3 is invalid: it exists before its parent record.

- I have a patch in the current Commit Fest that teaches Postgres how to implement temporal PKs and FKs.
  - No cascading DELETE/UPDATE yet:
    - I need temporal UPDATE/DELETE for that.



# Temporal Foreign Keys

```
CHECK (
  NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM   variants AS v
    -- There was a p when v started:
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM   products AS p
      WHERE  v.product_id = p.id
      AND    coalesce(lower(p.valid_at), '-infinity')
               <= coalesce(lower(v.valid_at), '-infinity')
      AND    coalesce(lower(v.valid_at), '-infinity')
               <= coalesce(upper(p.valid_at), 'infinity'))
    -- ...
```

Note:

- Snodgrass back in the 90s showed how to implement temporal foreign keys. Here it is....



# Temporal Foreign Keys

```
    -- ...
    -- There was a p when v ended:
    OR NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM   products AS p
      WHERE  v.product_id = p.id
      AND    coalesce(lower(p.valid_at), '-infinity')
               < coalesce(upper(v.valid_at), 'infinity')
      AND    coalesce(upper(v.valid_at), 'infinity')
               <= coalesce(upper(p.valid_at), 'infinity'))
    -- ...
```



# Temporal Foreign Keys

```
    -- ...
    -- There are no gaps in p throughout v:
    OR EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM   products AS p
      WHERE  v.product_id = p.id
      AND    coalesce(lower(v.valid_at), '-infinity')
               < coalesce(upper(p.valid_at), 'infinity')
      AND    coalesce(upper(p.valid_at), 'infinity')
               < coalesce(upper(v.valid_at), 'infinity')
    -- ...
```



# Temporal Foreign Keys

```
    -- ...
      AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM   products AS p2
        WHERE  p2.id = p.id
        AND    coalesce(lower(p2.valid_at), '-infinity')
                 <= coalesce(upper(p.valid_at), 'infinity')
        AND    coalesce(upper(p.valid_at), 'infinity')
                 < coalesce(upper(p2.valid_at), 'infinity')))))
```

Note:

- So obviously you don't really want to do this unless you have some help:
  - an extension or better yet native support from your database.



# Queries
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 60%" -->

|||&nbsp;
-|-|-
snapshot ("current") | at a given moment | <span style="white-space:nowrap">returns a traditional table</span><br/>(removes `valid_at`) | <code style="white-space:nowrap">WHERE valid_at @> t</code>
sequenced | across time | <span style="white-space:nowrap">returns a temporal table</span><br/>(preserves `valid_at`) | nothing, or<br/><code style="white-space:nowrap">WHERE valid_at && r</span>
non-sequenced | time is just another column | returns ??? |

Note:

- So we have these tables, and we want to query them....
- What kind of answers are we looking for?
  - "What was true at time t?" - snapshot query: result is a non-temporal relation
  - "Show me a history" - sequenced query: result is another temporal relation
- Snapshot queries are especially useful for auditing (i.e. transaction time).
  - You can judge the quality of an auditing extension by how easy it is to query the history: "Tardis" is great, `pg_audit_log` is useful but not something I'd want to query a lot.
  - Of course snapshot queries are useful for valid-time too.
- I'm not going to talk about non-sequenced queries because I've never found a plausible example of one.

Note:

- If we're doing queries of course we want joins.
  - As I like to say, if you can't do joins all you have is a spreadsheet.
- But joins are where things start to get hard.
  - Ad hoc solutions uninformed by the research fall down right around here.
  - You really want a principled approach to storing and querying temporal data.
- Here you have two tables from a hospitality system.
  - I'm more or less stolen this example from some researchers in Switzerland & Italy:
    - Anton Dignös
    - Michael Böhlen
    - Johann Gamper
    - apologies for my atrocious pronunciation
  - One table for price, since that changes based on weekends, holidays, Valentine's Day.
  - Another for reservations: when is each guest staying.
  - Now we want to see what each stay costs.

![offers and reservations](img/reservations.png)

![offers and reservations joined](img/reservations_joined.png)

Note:

- So here is the result.
- The first customer's stay is split across two cost periods,
  - so the join for them results in two rows;
  - same for the second customer.
- Note that the timestamps are not exactly from the first table or from the second;
  - we have to cut up the input records so they align.

![offers and reservations on a timeline joined](img/reservations_timeline_joined.png)

Note:

- Here is your result.
- Implementing this is tough!
  - Even Snodgrass's original ideas started to fall apart somewhere around here.
    - He showed how to handle joins, but 
    - he proposed putting temporal modifiers at the *statement* level, like as part of the `SELECT` clause.
      - This means temporal stuff was outside relational theory, sort of tacked on.
      - This made it hard to have complete generality: cover all cases.
      - Result sets would have start/end quasi-columns.
        - Queries didn't compose:
          - Putting a temporal query into a view, subquery, or CTE was a problem.
          - `SELECT * FROM t`: you lose information: the result isn't `t`.

- These problems were pointed out back in the 90s by Date & co,
  - but I think they weren't really solved until recently,
  - by Anton Dignös, Michael Böhlen, and Johann Gamper, researchers in Switzerland & Italy.
    - Instead of putting temporal qualifiers at the statement level,
    - they invent temporal variants of each operator in the relational algebra.
    - They show how to easily implement temporal variants of *all* relational operators (select, project, inner join, outer join, union, intersection, etc.) with just the traditional operators plus two new transforms, which they call `NORMALIZE` and `ALIGN`. The paper is a really easy read, so you should check it out!
    - Oh and they implemented it against Postgres 9.1, then 9.5, then submitted a patch against more recent versions.
    - They got some feedback about implementing their transforms in the wrong part of the query pipeline, and they submitted a patch fixing that, but I don't think anyone has responded to that.
    - Hopefully once PG 12 ships their patch will get some attention.
      - It is way more important than mine.

- There is nothing in SQL:2011 about temporal joins.
  - You can manage to do an `INNER JOIN` with the `OVERLAPS` operator, but that's all.
  - No outer joins
  - no aggregates
  - no union/intersect/difference



# Temporal INSERT
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide none" -->

![temporal INSERT](img/products_insert_timeline.png)

Note:

- So how do we manipulate temporal data?
- In normal databases, each row makes an assertion, typically about "now".
- In temporal databases, we assert something for a range in time.
- So we want to add that assertion.



# Temporal INSERT
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none none" -->

![temporal INSERT](img/products_insert_timeline_okay.png)

Note:

- This is a simple insert.
- Pretty simple: it works if it doesn't contradict any existing rows.



# Temporal INSERT
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none none" -->

![temporal INSERT](img/products_insert_timeline_coalescandum.png)

Note:

- But suppose we were INSERTing $5.....
- This is not really what we want.



# Temporal INSERT
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none slide" -->

![temporal INSERT](img/products_insert_timeline_coalesced.png)

Note:

- Coalesce: we want to avoid two adjacent records that assert the same thing; we want to merge them automatically.
  - This simplifies other logic elsewhere.
- Note there aren't any more rows than before:
  - The database invisibly transforms our INSERT into an UPDATE, just moving the date of the original row.
  - If we inserted something in between two other ranges, it would even UPDATE one and DELETE the other!
- Actually SQL:2011 leaves this out
  - So maybe we could/should skip it.
  - But your table will get more & more finely chopped.
  - Maybe add an optional trigger function you can attach.
    - What to do in Postgres about columns with no equality operator, e.g. json? (Cast json to jsonb first?) But is there a general solution?



# Temporal UPDATE
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide none" -->

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_update_timeline.png)

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_update_timeline_result.png)<!-- .element style="visibility:hidden" -->

Note:

- We update just a selected range.
- This UPDATE causes us to update two other records and INSERT another.
- Also needs to COALESCE afterward.



# Temporal UPDATE
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none slide" -->

<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide none" -->

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_update_2_timeline.png)

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_update_2_timeline_result.png)<!-- .element style="visibility:hidden" -->

Note:

- Can even cause a DELETE, if our UPDATE spans multiple existing records.



# Temporal UPDATE
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none slide" -->

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_update_2_timeline.png)

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_update_2_timeline_result.png)

<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide none" -->

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_delete_timeline.png)

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_delete_timeline_result.png)<!-- .element style="visibility:hidden" -->

Note:

- Actually the delete is translated to two UPDATEs.



# Temporal DELETE
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none slide" -->

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_delete_timeline.png)

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_delete_timeline_result.png)

Note:

- Of course a regular DELETE is possible too.
- Even an INSERT is possible, if you DELETE in the middle of an existing record.
- So with all these INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE commands getting translated into other operations,
  which triggers fire? And on which rows? And what are their NEW/OLD values?
  Does SQL:2011 have an opinion?



# Temporal UPSERT
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide none" -->

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_upsert_timeline.png)

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_upsert_timeline_result.png)<!-- .element style="visibility:hidden" -->

Note:

- aka `MERGE`
- It's really useful!
  - In a real application I built that lets you edit history this is what I used.
  - If this were an INSERT it would violate our primary key.
  - If this were an UPDATE it would lose the beginning.
- Nothing about this in SQL:2011
- Johnston calls this an `INSERT WHENEVER`
- Postgres's own `INSERT ON CONFLICT` won't help you here,
  - but I think we could teach it to.



# Temporal UPSERT
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none slide" -->

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_upsert_timeline.png)

![temporal UPDATE](img/products_upsert_timeline_result.png)

Note:

- Despite all this research on temporal databases, going back 3+ decades, there is almost no "full stack" research:
  - What is a good UX to let people edit the history of something?
    - See a list of "versions".
    - Merge two versions?
    - Change the transition date?
    - Cut off a version ("delete")?
    - Wipe out the whole record completely, for all time?
    - Save all the attributes at once (perfect for `UPSERT`), or save one attribute across multiple versions?
    - Do you need a save button, or can it work with save-as-you-type?
    - It's really complicated!
  - extensions to CRUD? REST?
  - Nice ORM presentation? (Martin Fowler, object models)
  - Transactions



# SQL:2011

Note:

- Okay, let's talk about SQL:2011!



# Range
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide none" -->

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id       integer,
  valid_at tstzrange,

  name     text,
  price    decimal(10,2),

  CONSTRAINT pk_products
    EXCLUDE
    (id WITH =, valid_at WITH &&)
);
```

Note:

- We've already seen this table.
- This is our DIY temporal primary key.
- But it's a shame that Postgres doesn't *know* it's a primary key.
- We're missing this higher-level concept of PKness.



# PERIOD
<!-- .slide: data-transition="none slide" -->

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id         integer,
  valid_from timestamptz NOT NULL,
  valid_til  timestamptz NOT NULL,

  name       text,
  price      decimal(10,2),

  PERIOD FOR valid_at
    (valid_from, valid_til),
  CONSTRAINT pk_products
    PRIMARY KEY
    (id, valid_at WITHOUT OVERLAPS)
);
```

Note:

- SQL:2011 doesn't have range types,
  so they added this idea of a "period".
- You see that you have separate start/end times,
  and you declare the PERIOD as a quasi-column.
- Then you make a primary key with `WITHOUT OVERLAPS`.

- Pretty nice that we have temporal primary keys.
- But having a quasi-column is a lot of trouble.



# PERIODS

```sql
SELECT * FROM t;
```

Note:

- PERIODs are not part of relational theory.
  - Date/Darwen/Lorentzos hate this.
  - Problems for composing, like putting a query into a view, or a subquery, or a CTE.
- This loses the PERIOD, but it doesn't lose ranges.
- Ranges have a richer set of operators.
- PERIODs are limited to dates and times, but ranges can be on anything.
- PERIODs don't permit a NULL to mean "unbounded";
  you have to use something like 3000 A.D.
  - (In Postgres dates & times technically have `-Infinity` and `Infinity`,
    although I've found these are not always so well-supported in client programming languages and their database libraries.)
- You can make GiST indexes on ranges, and make exclusion constraints.
- Implementation is probably a chore too:
  - Everywhere Postgres accepts a column, we'd have to accept a column or a PERIOD.
    - So SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, function arguments, some DDL commands (indexes, constraints)
  - Just my impression; maybe others know better.
- Supposedly the standard authors added `PERIOD` so that RDMBS vendors and tooling vendors wouldn't have to add new column types, but adding a whole new not-exactly-a-column thing seems way worse.



# Ranges

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id       integer,
  valid_at tstzrange,

  name     text,
  price    decimal(10,2),

  CONSTRAINT pk_products
    PRIMARY KEY
    (id, valid_at WITHOUT OVERLAPS)
);
```

Note:

- In my own patch I accept ranges where the standard accepts PERIODs.
- I'd like to support both PERIODs and ranges.
- Since the PERIOD name must not conflict with any column names,
  it's easy to accept both without ambiguity.
- Implementation will probably use ranges with exclusion constraints regardless.
- Vik Fearing already has a patch that lets you declare PERIODs, but not use them.



# DML

```sql
INSERT INTO products (id, price, valid_at)
VALUES (1, 5, tstzrange(.....);

UPDATE products
FOR PORTION OF valid_at FROM t1 TO t2
SET price = 4
WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM products
FOR PORTION OF valid_at FROM t1 TO t2
WHERE id = 1;
```

Note:

- Here is what temporal DML looks like.
- No change to INSERT.
  - Whether it's two timestamp columns or a single range column, no new syntax is needed.
- `FOR PORTION OF` for UPDATE and DELETE.
- This syntax requires separate start and end times, but it'd be nice to support ranges there too.
- You can't SET the start & end times when doing an UPDATE FOR PORTION OF (which seems reasonable).



# System Time

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id       integer,
  sys_from timestamp GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START,
  sys_til  timestamp GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END,

  name       text,
  price      decimal(10,2),

  PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME
    (sys_from, sys_til)
) WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING;
```

Note:

- I've totally ignored the second dimension: system time, but SQL:2011 has that too.
- You add these `GENERATED` columns (which we support now!),
- then you define a period with the magic name `SYSTEM_TIME`,
- and you say the table has `SYSTEM VERSIONING`.
- Then you get automatic transaction-time history.
- DML (insert/update/delete) works just like a non-temporal table.



# System Time

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   products
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF t;

SELECT *
FROM   products
FOR SYSTEM_TIME FROM t1 TO t2;
```

Note:

- You can query at a given point in time, or for a given range.
- You can always say `BETWEEN t1 AND t2` instead of `FROM t1 TO t2`,
  and you get closed/closed instead of closed/open semantics.



# MariaDB

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id    integer,
  name  text,
  price decimal(10,2)
) WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING;

SELECT *, row_start, row_end FROM products;
```

Note:

- Supports the standard syntax,
- and also this abbreviated syntax.
  - Gives you pseudo-columns `row_start` and `row_end`.
- I don't know what the system catalog says for a table like this.
- Btw MariaDB and MySQL don't support valid-time PERIODs yet.
  - Still the theme of database auditing but not entity history!



# Oracle

```sql
ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA;

SELECT * FROM t AS OF TIMESTAMP t;
```

Note:

- Here is how Oracle does system-time tables.
- Oracle 12c
- Just based on reading the docs.
- Lots of other commands to set it up.
- Nothing like the SQL:2011 syntax.



# Oracle
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 90%" -->

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id         int,
  valid_from timestamp,
  valid_til  timestamp,

  name  text,
  price decimal(10,2),

  PERIOD FOR valid_at (valid_from, valid_til)
);

SELECT * FROM products
AS OF PERIOD FOR valid_at t;

SELECT * FROM products
VERSIONS PERIOD FOR valid_at BETWEEN t1 AND t2;
```

Note:

- Also valid time!
- Note the "FOR" in the `PERIOD` use. (Easier for the parser?)
- According to the docs the constituent columns can be nullable, although the standard says they must be `NOT NULL`. I *think* this just means that it automatically not-null-icates them, like you'd do with a PRIMARY KEY.



# MS SQL Server
<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 90%" -->

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.Products (
  Id      integer PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED,
  SysFrom datetime2(2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START,
  SysTil  datetime2(2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END,
  Name    text,
  Price   decimal(10, 2),
  PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (SysFrom, SysTil)
) WITH (
  SYSTEM VERSIONING = ON
    (HISTORY TABLE = dbo.ProductsHistory)
);
```

Note:

- Available in SQL Server 2016.
- You create your product table with the usual `SYSTEM_TIME` `PERIOD`.
- Then you use this second command to give it system versioning,
  naming the table where the old versions go.
  - This is a very reasonable implementation for system-time information IMO.
  - `temporal_tables` and "Tardis for your ORM" take this approach too.
  - Maybe it'd be nice if it weren't quite so exposed.
- So I guess you query that table if you want old information.
- I haven't tested this myself.
- Also interesting: you can make the `SysFrom` and `SysTil` columns `HIDDEN` so they aren't included in `SELECT *`---just like the `PERIOD`!
- No support for valid-time `PERIOD`s.
- If someone says, "Everyone else already supports SQL:2011 temporal tables; why are you so slow Postgres?"
  - Yeah, they support the boring parts.



# IBM DB2

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id       int,
  sys_from timestamp(12) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW BEGIN,
  sys_til  timestamp(12) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END,
  tx_id    timestamp(12) GENERATED ALWAYS AS TRANSACTION START ID,

  name  text,
  price decimal(10,2),

  PERIOD SYSTEM_TIME (sys_from, sys_til)
);
```

Note:

- System time
- No need for `WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING`.
- Note `BEGIN` vs `START` in SQL:2011/MariaDB/SQL Server.
- What is `tx_id` about?



# IBM DB2

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id         int,
  valid_from timestamp(12) NOT NULL,
  valid_til  timestamp(12) NOT NULL,

  name  text,
  price decimal(10,2),

  PERIOD BUSINESS_TIME (valid_from, valid_til)
);
```

Note:

- Supports valid-time!



# Postgres?

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id         integer,
  claimed_at tstzrange GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW RANGE,
  name       text,
  price      decimal(10,2)
) WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING (claimed_at);
```

Note:

- I've talked about valid-time syntax, but maybe our range-friendly system-time syntax would look like this.
